## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Language Configuration
```javascript
const languages = {
    'en': { name: 'English', flag: 'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸' },
    'hi': { name: 'à¤¹à¤¿à¤‚à¤¦à¥€', flag: 'ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³' },
    'mr': { name: 'à¤®à¤°à¤¾à¤ à¥€', flag: 'ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³' }
};

const responses = {
    'en': { /* English responses */ },
    'hi': { /* Hindi responses */ },
    'mr': { /* Marathi responses */ }
};
```

### Safety Alert System
- Uses React state management for alert tracking
- Automatic cleanup of old alerts (keeps only latest 2)
- Visual distinction with red color scheme
- Integration with voice synthesis system

### Route Optimization
- Real-time analysis of crowd density data
- Dynamic recommendations based on current conditions
- Multi-language support for all recommendations

## ðŸš€ Next Steps & Future Enhancements

### Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Test multi-language functionality with actual users
2. [ ] Verify speech synthesis works across all browsers
3. [ ] Add more languages (Tamil, Telugu, Bengali)
4. [ ] Implement language persistence using localStorage

### Advanced Features
1. [ ] Add push notifications for critical safety alerts
2. [ ] Implement geofencing for location-specific alerts
3. [ ] Add voice recognition for language switching
4. [ ] Create admin panel for managing alert templates
