# Mobile Camera People Counting System - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add TensorFlow.js dependency to package.json
- [x] Create public directory for web assets
- [x] Configure server to serve static files

## Phase 2: Web Interface ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create index.html with camera interface
- [x] Create camera.js for person detection logic
- [x] Create styles.css for responsive design

## Phase 3: Computer Vision Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement TensorFlow.js person detection
- [x] Add people counting logic
- [x] Implement alert system for >2 people

## Phase 4: Backend Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add gate-specific endpoints to server.js
- [x] Integrate with existing alert system
- [x] Update threshold for gate monitoring

## Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Test camera access on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify person detection accuracy
- [ ] Test alert system functionality

## Current Status: Ready for Testing

### Testing Instructions:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm start`
3. Open your mobile browser and navigate to: `http://[your-local-ip]:5000`
4. Allow camera access when prompted
5. Point camera at a gate area with people
6. Test with 1-2 people (should show normal status)
7. Test with 3+ people (should trigger gate violation alert)

### Mobile Testing Tips:
- Use your phone's browser (Chrome/Safari)
- Ensure you're on the same network as the server
- Replace `[your-local-ip]` with your computer's local IP address
- The system works best in well-lit conditions
